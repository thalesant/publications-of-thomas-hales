General comments:
- I suggest adding more bibliographical references to your text here
  and there, in order to reference the publication by you and by your
  collaborators. It would be very useful for readers who want to delve
  into further details. Suggestions below.

-- fixed
  
- It seems to me that the way you treat names is not uniform
  (e.g. Thomas Harriot vs Hilbert vs W.-Y. Hsiang). Also, would you
  insist on calling Samuel Ferguson Sam p4?

-- I now give the full name on first mention, then last name on subsequent
mentions.

In order:

- p.2, "series of preprints posted to the ArXiv". Consider inserting
  references.

-- fixed
  
- p3: it was not obvious to me what (the type of) V is in the formal
  statement, although you clearly use V for the set of centers of
  balls at the top of the page. May be a few words like "where $V$ is
  a set of points in R^3" (or whatever correct variant).

-- fixed


- p4: I did not understand the 1st paragraph "To push simplicity ..."
  Naive question: pi is involved in the classical statement about the
  optimal density given p3, in which the large spherical container is
  irrelevant, isn't it?

-- explanation added

- p4 Reference [Sch] lacks a venue or url.

-- fixed

- p4 See my comment above about "Sam", the reader might not see
  immediately who it is.

-- fixed

- p4 About the relevance of QE. It is not clear to me why it is
  necessary to truncate cells with polyhedra, rather than balls, to
  make the problem fall in the 1st order theory of real closed
  fields. I do not have a precise idea about the precise mathematics
  involved behind this paragraph but the a change of polyhedra for
  balls looks like one which preserves definability, and partitions
  thus shall remain described by semi-algebraic functions.

-- explanation added. The issue is essentially the same as with the "push simplicity" issue above.
   The Tarski statement must encode volumes (via their algebraic formulas), and this
   cannot be done for ball-based truncation.
  
- p5 l.1 hybrid decomposition -> hybrid partition?

-- fixed

- p5 end of 1st paragraph "decomposition star decomposition" (typo)

-- fixed

- p5 l.3 of 2nd paragraph, "His partition" missing "s" (plural)

-- fixed

- p5 l.5 of 3rd paragraph "that must hold of any planar graph" for any
  planar graph?

-- fixed

- p6, 2nd paragraph "Gonthier's formalization" : note for ourselves,
  editors, a cross-reference could be inserted here to the
  corresponding section of the book.
  I enjoyed this section 3.3.

-- no change

- note for ourselves, editors, insert a citation for systems
  (HOL-Light, Isabelle)
  I guess it is a deliberate choice not to mention Isabelle in the
  header of section 4.

-- no change

p10-11 (section 5.2) I guess that citing Solovyev's papers, or may be
his PhD thesis if it is available online, would be very relevant.

-- added

p10 to 12 : what about swapping sections 5.2 and 5.3?

-- fixed

p12, section 5.3 What about citing publication(s) by Obua? May be
