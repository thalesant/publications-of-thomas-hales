(*
Meet-in-the-middle verifications of
multi-triangle estimates.

One triangle is designated a central.
The others are peripheral.
Each peripheral triangle must share an edge with the central triangle.

We make hash tables of areas of peripheral triangles.
Then we compute area of central triangle and
find total area of the cluster of triangles.

The keys for the hash tables are derived from shared coords
along common edges.

We structure the problems so that we wish to prove that
various domains are empty.  
That is, we subdivide until everything is out-of-domain.
