* Pentagon computer code

- This directory contains the computer code that is used in the proof of
the pentagonal ice-ray conjecture of Henley, Kuperberg, and Kuperberg.

- The source code was written in 2016 in Objective Caml (.ml) and Mathematica (.m).
  
- The Objective Caml interval arithmetic code relies on Jean-Marc Alliot's
    interval arithmetic package.  This library only works on Intel processors.

        - The init.ml file gives a few comments about how to initialize Alliot's package.


    Alliot's source code: https://www.alliot.fr/fbbdet.html.fr
    Source code republished by Christope Troestler on github https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-interval/

- There are no other dependencies on outside packages.
